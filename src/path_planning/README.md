✨ Path planning in robotics
----------------------------
Path planning problems can be divided into two parts, trajectory generation
and smoothness.

✨ Trajectory generation
------------------------
### Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning (CHOMP)


✨ Trajectory smoothness
------------------------
### Non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS)
